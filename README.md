# Liver-islet MPS: Computational modelling of the liver-islet MPS.

The files can be used to reproduce the results in the paper "Integrated experimental-computational analysis of a liver-islet micophysiological system for human-centric diabetes research". 

The scripts are implemented in Matlab R2018b and use IQM toolbox, which can be installed from:

To reproduce the results in the manuscript:

1. Download the files from each experiment, included in the 'Experiments folder'
2. Run the script 'plotResults' in the folder corresponding to each experiment:

-Experiment 1: Extrapolation of the "in vitro" results to the "in vivo" case.

-Experiment 2: Model-based analysis of the physiological processes behind impaired glucose homeostasis under hyperglycemia + model evaluation (prediction of glucose and insulin concentration in each culture compartment)

-Experiment 3: Model-based analysis of impaired glucose homeostasis under varying glycemic regimes + model evaluation (prediction of glucose and insulin responses under hypoglycemia)
